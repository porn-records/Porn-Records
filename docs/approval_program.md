# Issue managemen
Thanks to Dante (@cat) we now have a inline tool that is to be used
within our Gitlab issue. This tool can be used by our
[developers][Permissions_and_roles] and higher


## What collaborators can do from now

### New
The /commit (or shortcut /ok) was added. e.g. @reporter ok

#### Commands

```md
@reporter ok
```

Or

```md
@reporter /ok
```

Or

```md
@reporter commit
```

Or

```md
@reporter /commit
```

This command only works on Porn Records' open issues.
This will read the issue, add domains to porn files & push commit.


### Minor
Another shortcut named /en is added, identical to /translate this.
